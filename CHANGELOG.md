# Changelog

## October 12, 2026

- Favorites order links follow the current roll; phone carousel has a visible named order button.
- Exact catalog ID/name added to existing order-click measurement; general order links preserved.

All notable changes to this repo will be documented here.

## 2026-08-20

### Changed
- Updated the documented GitHub SSH identity from the retired automation key to the active `arcos33` key.

## 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Hero notice banner** (`components/notice-banner.html`): reusable, documented temporary-announcement component — frosted dark-glass pill with a gold pulsing status dot, designed to sit in the hero over the video. Self-contained style + markup + optional timezone-proof auto-hide script. First deployed as a "Closed for lunch today / dinner resumes at 4:30 PM" notice, set to auto-hide at 3:00 PM MDT.

## 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **Memorial Day hero cleanup**: Restored the default homepage hero video sources (the Memorial Day clip was still hardcoded in `index.html` after the theme’s date range ended).
- **Theme loader correctness**:
  - Clears the `.theme-badge` text when a theme doesn’t define `badgeText`.
  - Improves hero handling so “default” reliably restores the standard hero reels.
  - Ensures themed floating containers (e.g. `.floating-stars`) are hidden/cleared when a theme disables floaters.

### Added
- **Hamburger Day (2026) theme** (`themes/hamburger-day-2026.json`):
  - One-day auto theme for **2026-05-28**.
  - Desktop hero uses `assets/images/hamburger_day.png`.
  - Mobile hero uses `assets/images/hamburger_day_portrait.png`.
- **Hero image source switching**: Added support for `content.heroImageSources` so a theme can supply separate landscape/portrait hero images.

### Changed
- **Hamburger Day hero layout**: Hides the standard hero badge/tagline/title/subtitle for this theme so the promo artwork isn’t covered; keeps CTA buttons visible.

## 2026-09-27 — Approved design recovery

Restored the approved homepage and committed its complete public source/build configuration to main so scheduled review syncs preserve the design.


### 2026-09-28 — Approved customer QR menu release
Owner explicitly approved replacing the live /menu with the reviewed continuous menu. Promoted approved UI from preview commit 0a88911 onto current production main, preserving existing site analytics, QR URL and canonical menu content. Build derives data/customer-menu.json from the existing js/menu-page.js menu block, enriching photo presentation from data/menu-presentation.json. Existing homepage unchanged. Build, 9 analytics tests, 3 menu integration checks, all photo paths, 60-row rendering, rapid category jumps and full-width detail/return verified locally. Deployment verification follows publication.

## 2026-10-01 — Approved animated hero sunrise

Replaced the small static hero sunrise with the approved Quiet dawn SVG: sequential rays, a gentle staggered wave swell, and a two-unit raised sun. Increased stroke width from 3 to 3.75 for clarity at hero size. Plays once in under four seconds; reduced-motion users see the finished mark. Hero copy, photography, ordering, reviews and QR menu preserved. Owner explicitly authorized commit, push and production publication.


## October 3, 2026 — Favorites tracking
Added production favorites section/roll visibility and per-roll exploration measurement, distinguishing touch swipes, arrow controls, keyboard and named selectors. No visual changes.

## October 12, 2026 — Kitchen gallery ordering prepared

Added named direct Square links below all six kitchen photos, retaining the existing grid and imagery. Exact item/variation IDs come from the live catalog; the existing menu identifies the sashimi photo as Sashimi Platter. Gallery uses placement `kitchen-gallery` and list `homepage_kitchen`, separate from Favorites. All six public destinations opened correctly through PiKVM. Desktop, 400px and 320px browser layouts passed; the 320px platter action opened the correct item. No purchase submitted.

Validation: 14 website unit checks, 111 theme checks, build; 36 dashboard backend/export checks and actual-data rendering. Live GA checked all five existing gallery dish/order pairs with no errors; none showed a gallery journey. First genuine post-release gallery purchase remains unobserved.

Publication pending: automatic approval review rejected production push, requiring explicit approval for public website and live dashboard deployment. Source and preview are ready.

## October 12, 2026 — Kitchen gallery released

Joel explicitly approved publishing the website and dashboard after the automatic approval gate. Website code 46b6552 deployed as Netlify 6acd0f3adae81820fc9f17a7; live HTML/CSS and unchanged Favorites scripts/QR menu match built files. Six named dish-order links retain the gallery photos and grid. All six Square public items were verified, including the Sashimi Platter identity from the existing menu. Desktop, 400px and 320px browser views passed; narrow preview platter action opened the exact item. Published narrow gallery rendered successfully. Physical iPhone testing was not performed.

Dashboard deploy scoped to lib/website_favorites.py, lib/website_ga.py, tabs/website_orders.py and current-month GA cache. Backup: /private/tmp/hikari-gallery-runtime-backup-20261012. Source/runtime hashes match; restarted service health 200; deployed actual-data rendering passes. Live GA checked five gallery dish/order pairs, zero verified gallery journeys, no query errors. Favorites kept separate. Checks: 14 website unit checks, 111 theme checks, 36 backend/export checks.

Next: observe the first genuine post-release gallery-link purchase and exact paid Square item. No test order was placed, and no completed gallery conversion is claimed.

## 2026-10-14 — Mail research pages prepared

Added a draft `/mail-research/` route with app homepage, privacy, terms, and isolated styling to the production build. Nothing published.

## 2026-10-14 — Mail research information pages published

Published the `/mail-research/` homepage, privacy policy, terms, and isolated
stylesheet from commit `beaf8ce` on `main`. The privacy copy describes the
actual macOS Keychain grant store. All three public routes and CSS return 200;
Netlify pretty-URL rewriting changes link markup but preserves approved text.
The restaurant homepage and menu remain byte-identical to the tested build.
